Alp Demirtas (ademirt1)
Ryan Amer (ramer2)

Alp worked on the imgproc_tile, the imgproc_composite functions, the determine_tile_x_offset, the determine_tile_y_offset, copy_tile, determine_tile_w, determine_tile_h, and all_tiles_nonempty functions.
Ryan worked on the void imgproc_mirror_h, imgproc_mirror_v, imgproc_grayscale, make_pixel, get_pixel, set_pixel, get_r, get_g, get_b, get_a, to_grayscale, blend_components, and blend_color functions.
The two partners evenly split the responsibilities for writing the unit tests for the functions.

An interesting implementaiton that this project utilized was writing the get pixel, read pixel, and set pixel as helper functions before implementing any of the other functions. This made writing the code much more syntactically easier and made hte code more efficient.
