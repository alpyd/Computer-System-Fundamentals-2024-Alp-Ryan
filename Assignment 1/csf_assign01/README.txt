Ryan Amer (ramer2)

Assignment 1 Contributions:
Both partners contributed equally to the assignment. Alp wrote the constructor for the BigInt class and wrote the first drafts of the is_negative, operator=, get_bits, get_bit_vector, and to_hex methods. He also wrote additional unit tests for these functions.
Ryan troubleshooted and edited the is_negative, operator=, get_bits, get_bit_vector, and to_hex methods. He also wrote the first draft of some of the methods due the following week, such as set_magnitude, add_magnitudes, subtract_magnitudes, operator+ and operator-.

Interesting Implementations:
An interesting implementation is that an intialization of a BigInt object without any elements in the magnitude array and the negative boolean being false. While there were many ways to demonstrate 0, we chose this approach to easily distinguish a 0 value with the length being equal to 0.
